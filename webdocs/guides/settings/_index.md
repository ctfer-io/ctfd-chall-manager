## Goal
This guide assumes you are a CTF administrator with a properly configured infrastructure and an understanding of key concepts.Before or during your event, you may need to update the total amount of mana for Source or change the chall-manager API URL.

## Monitoring

To perform an update, Go to `Guides` > `Settings`, (1) select the text input, edit it, then (2) submit form, as shown below:

{{% imgproc setting-update Fit "800x800" %}}
{{% /imgproc %}}

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
We strongly recommends you to NOT edit the chall-manager API URL during your event.
{{% /alert %}}
